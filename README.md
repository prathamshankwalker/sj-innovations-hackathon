### üìÉ Problem Statement

As there are multiple resources working on multiple projects it becomes difficult to manage the workload and get a proper idea which resources are under or over-utilized. Hence build a web application portal to do the projection for members with respect to projects on a weekly basis. Also if the resources are on leave or there is a holiday the capacity of the members will have to be reduced accordingly.

- **Admin Module :**
    - Login/registration.
    - Work on Resource Projection and Leave Management of employees/resources.
    - There should be a tracking of which admin has made which 

- **Super Admin Module :**
    - Login/registration
    - Can add/remove admins to a particular Pods/group of resources/employees


### üìã Features

- **Resource Projection :** The admin should be able to add hrs for Resources wrt to project - So each resource will have multiple projects assigned to them in a particular week and that will have the hrs - There should be a tracking of which admin has made which changes in the system.

- **Leave Management :** Here the admin should be able to add leaves (half or full day) or holiday for the resources on a day to day basis - Once a leave is marked the capacity of the member should be reduced accordingly - There should be an interface where the admin can visualise the entire team's availability.

### üß¨ Vision

- Creating an admin friendly user interface for efficient resource booking and workload handling.

- Employee stress/ happiness tracking using machine learning.
